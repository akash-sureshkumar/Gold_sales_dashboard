# ðŸ“Š Gold Sales Analysis & Forecasting (2023â€“2024)

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting **gold product sales** using Python and Machine Learning.  
The goal is to compare sales trends across years, visualize insights, and build forecasting models for both overall and product-specific sales.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Cleaned and prepared gold sales data (2023â€“2024).
- Created features like **Year** and **Month** for time-based analysis.![Uploading 1st one.pngâ€¦]()

- Visualized:
  - Product sales comparison (2023 vs 2024)
  - Monthly total sales trends
  - Forecast vs actual sales
- Built forecasting models:
  - **Linear Regression** (baseline)
  - **XGBoost Regressor** (performed better with lower MSE)
- Forecasted:
  - Total sales for the next **3 months**
  - Product-specific sales for the next **6 months**
- Saved trained models using **joblib**.
